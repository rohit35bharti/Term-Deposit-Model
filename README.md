# Term-Deposit-Model
Implementation of a machine learning algorithm to predict if a customer to a bank will subscribe to term deposit.

### Goal
The objective is to implement a classifier with a high accuracy that the bank can use to develop a more efficient campaign strategy that will guarantee the subscription of more customers to term deposit hence generating more profits for the bank while minimising the cost spent on the campaign.

### Result
The accuracy score indicated a 96.9% accuracy which is viewed as a very good accuracy score. The accuracy is computed by comparing the predicted values to the actual test values.
